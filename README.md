## Description

A tool to select or unselect some resources from a set of `k8s` manifests (e.g, from `helm template` output).
The tool is useful for quick debugging and patching.

This is the new and the official repository for the small script https://gist.github.com/icy/228d7ce15b6c1fc66994a490608e6c7c . 
The script is written now in Ruby, and it needs some better documentation, e2e tests and some ehancements.
